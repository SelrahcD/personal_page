title: PhpStorm = ❤️
description: "Starting to use PhpStorm was one of the best decision of my career. That tool brings me so much joy.

In that talk I explain how combining the refactoring tools provided by the IDE and homemade tools based on Live Templates makes me super efficient, even if I'm a slow typist."

Want to be a 1.5x developper? Maybe I can help.

In this talk I demonstrate how the refactoring tools and the Live Templates from PhpStorm, or actually any other Jetbrains IDE, gives us super-power.

In a few minutes, we are able to modify a test to introduce a builder for our test data, in several places, using only a few keystrokes and with a low risk of making any mistake.
