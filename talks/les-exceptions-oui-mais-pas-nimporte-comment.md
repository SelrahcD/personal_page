Like all of us, I sometimes deal with legacy code to add some new features. This 
an excellent opportunity to improve the code and probably to introduce tests as well.

I noticed those poorly handled exceptions made introducing tests a tedious task. 
It led me to reflect on how we use exceptions and what we can do to improve the situation.

In this short talk, I share some guidelines I follow when I'm about to throw an exception.
These guidelines improve our ability to maintain, evolve and monitor our applications.
