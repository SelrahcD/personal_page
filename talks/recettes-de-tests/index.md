We all know how essential tests are to ensure our applications are working correctly, 
to help keep our codebase maintainable, and us productive.

Unfortunately, poorly designed tests might, in fact, slow us down in the long run.

This talk outlines some useful tricks to keep tests on our sides. It also demonstrates 
that tests give feedback about the design of an application and how they can act as 
documentation.
