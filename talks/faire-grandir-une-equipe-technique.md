I've been working for the same company for enough time to see the dev team grow 
from 5 to 40 people.

The ride was exciting and came with some challenges. 

How can we stay as productive as we were? How can we ensure everyone keeps learning 
and improving? How can we maintain an adequate level of understanding of the codebase 
for all? How can we keep communication flowing in the community and between teams? 
How do we even split teams ?

This talk shares part of what we've done to answer these issues.
