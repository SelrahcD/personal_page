        <p class="font-semibold">When I went independent, my goal was to help more teams reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>I'm a developer for a lot of years now. It all started as a game while I was a kid, trying to understand how websites
            were made and later turned into a job. </p>

        <p>Along the way, I've learned that sustainably delivering value to users comes from a good understanding of
            their
            needs,
            rightly applied technical skills, and an environment focused on team autonomy.</p>

        <p>It was time for me to move to an Agile & Craft coach position to grow this agile mindset in other
            teams.</p>

        <p>If you're curious about Domain Driven Design, TDD, BDD, CQRS, Hexagonal architecture, event-sourcing, if you
            feel
            you're
            not going as fast as you could, or if you face some challenges you don't know how to approach, maybe we
            should
            discuss!</p>

            <p>I've been mostly focused on backend development with PHP and Elixir for a while, but I'll be more than happy to pair on some front-end code as well.

                We can take a few hours or days together to discuss an issue you have, see how it can be resolved, or review
                architectural decisions to ensure you're heading in the right direction according to your goals.

            <p>External ideas and points of view sometimes help!</p>
