        <p class="font-semibold">When I went independent, my goal was to help more teams reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>I've been a developer for a lot of years now. It all started as a game while I was a kid, trying to understand how websites were made, and later turned into a job.</p>

        <p>Along the way, I've learned that sustainably delivering value to users comes from a good understanding of their needs, rightly applied technical skills, and an environment focused on team autonomy.</p>

        <p>It was time for me to move to an Agile & Craft coach position to grow this agile and product-oriented mindset in other teams.</p>

        <p>I have a vast range of interests, from pure technical stuff to product management and organization strategy. To be honest, I'm not an expert in every subject, and this is probably not a problem. I know enough about these topics to start conversations, ask the questions you wouldn't ask, challenge the status quo, and bring people with different perspectives together to work toward a common goal as a team.</p>

            <p>I can join your team as a technical coach.</p>

            <p>Together we will identify the main pain points you are facing, and I will guide you toward their resolution, pointing out what's missing, creating a learning path to make sure you'll be able to do it on your own after I'm out, and making sure you stay on track.</p>

                Sometimes our current system prevents us from achieving our goals, everything is entangled, and we're moving slower than we'd like; we're unable to adapt and lose some business opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>We'll work together to understand how your architecture could align with your company strategy.</p>

            <p>We'll decompose your system into proper boundaries aligned with how your business operates. This will allow teams to be autonomous and enable a fast flow of changes, creating a better environment for achieving your goals.</p>
