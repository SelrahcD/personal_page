<div class="text">
    <p class="mt-12">I sometimes code during evenings and week-ends, most of the time for experimenting, but, once in a while, a project is interesting enough to go online.</p>
    <p>Here they are!</p>
    <p>If you're interested in the projects that didn't make the cut, you can find them on <a href="https://github.com/SelrahcD">Github</a>.</p>

        <div class="text mt-4">
            <p class="font-semibold">Burritalks.io references interesting talks around development and creating software.</p>

            <p>As an avid learner, I watch a lot of conferences online.</p>
            <p>Some people are waiting for the next season of their favorite show;
                I'm waiting for some conferences to publish the recorded talks.
            </p>
            <p>While coaching teams, I sometimes refer to talks, and I felt it would be convenient to
                group them.
                I decided to make a website out of the list as it can probably be a useful resource for others as
                well.
            </p>
            <p>The website is built on top of Hugo, with Tailwind CSS and
                some a JS built CLI to help with repetitive tasks.

    <div class="md:w-1/2">
        <span class="khand text-scarlet-700 text-2xl">Schtroumpsify</span>

        <div class="text mt-4">
            <p class="font-semibold">Schtroumpsify is a Twitter bot translating all tweets from the French newspaper Le Monde in smurf language.</p>

            <p>It all started with a discussion at the coffee maker: Would it be possible
                to build an automated translater from French to Smurf?
            </p>

            <p>I decided to give it a try and looked for a use case. I decided to build a
                bot that will tweet in Smurf every tweet from the French newspaper Le Monde.
            </p>

            <p>I found a French grammatical parser developed by the INRIA, the French National
                Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. I built a node application
                calling a forgotten demo version running on their machines.
            </p>

            <p>They ended up removing the service at some point, killing the bot at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>Later, I started learning Elixir and decided to resuscitate the bot.</p>

            <p>I found a docker image of the parser, which was unfortunately really heavy - think 10Gb -,
                and decided to shrink its size. This was the first part of the revival of the
                Schtroumpsifier - Schtroumpf is French for Smurf.
            </p>

            <p>Once able to parse French again, I built a Phoenix application displaying the
                tweets in realtime and automatically tweeting translated news.
